<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">My name is Lovira L. Putri.
  I am a Master of Applied Cybernetics student at the Australian National University.</p>

<h2>This is my Build Journey!</h2>
</ul>

<h3> First Checkpoint</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The first skill I hope to develop throughout this course is (more) Python. More specifically, 

  <p><strong>Python for text data analysis and creative computing</strong>.</p>
  <h4 id="why-python-for-text-data-analysis-and-creative-computing">Why Python for text data analysis and creative computing:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><h4 id="professionalacademic">Professional/Academic:</h4>
  <p>My research interests are at the intersection of cultural analytics, digital humanities, and library/information science.  I am particularly interested in using computational methods to analyze cultural materials,  now that many of these materials have been digitized.</p>
  <p>To do this, I need a strong grasp of Python, as python is one of the most common computational tools used in the field and will be instrumental to my research. </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4 id="personal">Personal:</h4>
  <p>I believe that creative pursuits should not be considered as less than compared to empirical or scientific pursuits. Instead, they should complement each other, dancing together in to harmonic tune to bring about a more holistic, enriching and inclusive understanding of the world we live in. </p>
  <p>My goal is to explore my artistic/creative abilities during my time at the School of Cybernetics, utilizing the school&#39;s available resources.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  
  <h4 id="current-python-experience-and-skill-level">Current Python experience and skill level:</h4>
  <p>My current skill level is beginner-intermediate.
  Prior coming to the School of Cybernetics, I had experience with:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Behavioural data analysis (EEG data)using MNE-Python package</li>
  <li>Basic text data manipulation using NLTK</li>
  <li>Self-taught Python for Digital Humanities online modules, which involved:<ul>
  <li>Manipulating strings</li>
  <li>Working with .txt data (files, frequency distributions, plots, regex, and web scraping)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="end-goal">End Goal</h4>
  <p>By the end of the course, I hope to:</p>

  <h3 id="machine-yearning"><em>Machine Yearning</em></h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
  The first BUILD homework assignment involved a free drawing exercise using AxiDraw and Python. It was a unique experience that allowed me to channel my creativity through computation and code.
  
  <br>
  My motivation to create an artwork came from a desire to revisit the past-- after a class session on Reflexive Writing-- where I had reread a journal entry that I had written before leaving for Canberra. 
  </div>
  
  <p><img src="/images/journal_entry.jpg" width="400"></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>A snippet of my journal entry from January 14th 2023. Written at Structure Coffee, Montréal, QC</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This prompted me to reflect on my personal journey, which sparked a desire to further immortalise a memory of a past.</p>
  <p>The aftermath of the yearning session was an untitled poem. </p>
  <div style="text-align: left">
  <i>
  in between, 
  
  
  <p>the Lover surrenders</p>
  <p>a tranquil touch</p>
  <p>weaves in waves of rush</p>
  <p>a coveted muse of the pen and the brush </p>
  <hr>
  <p>blessed by the Tenth Muse of Lesbos--</p>
  <p>the Lovers dance</p>
  <p>burning wood and chestnut scent--</p>
  <p>in a trance</p>
  <p>snowfall up north--</p>
  <p>burying the entrance</p>
  <hr>
  <p>pang!</p>
  <p>time is up</p>
  <p>at Her peak,</p>
  <p>the moon is now frozen</p>
  <p>in between,</p>
  <p>is now out of bounds for the Lovers</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Beloved,</p>
  <p>until then</p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em></p>
  <p><em>haunt me</em>
  </i></p>
  </div>
  
  
  <div style="text-align: justify">
  With this poem in hand, I wanted to somehow use this, or at least an element of the poem, for the fortnight 1 BUILD homework. Due to the time constraint, I had to choose a snippet of the poem to use, and I chose the last stanza -- my personal favourite stanza -- of the poem.
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I  then realized that manually plotting each letter using the Latin alphabet would be too time-consuming, so I looked for an alternative method that would allow me to represent the poem with minimal code. Eventually, I settled on using ASCII representation, where each letter is represented by pairs of zeroes and ones.
  <br></p>
  <p>To do this, I created two function to plot zero and one, and then created functions to plot each of the four possible pairs: 00, 01, 10, and 11.</p>
  </div>
  
  
  
  <p><img src="/images/machine_yearning.jpg" width="500">  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Machine Yearning</em>  (2023)</strong> <br>pen on paper
  <br>5.8 x 8.3 in</p>
  </blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
  <strong><i>Machine Yearning</i></strong> is an artwork consisting of five words represented in binary that depicts a crazy lover's visceral yearning for the beloved.
  
  <p>The text reads:</p>
  <pre><code>beloved, 
  
  until then
  
  haunt me
  
                      haunt  me (x10)   
  </code></pre>
  <p>It is a story about separation, wherein the mad lover in this story begs for the beloved to haunt her until <em>then</em> comes around.  </p>
  <p>To elucidate the sense of madness, the binary strings on the right side are ten randomised loops of the phrase &quot;haunt me&quot;. Here, the lover is clearly consumed by the ever-consuming force of yearning for the beloved.</p>
  <p>This line was heavily inspired by a line from Emily Brontë&#39;s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>&quot;You said I killed you, Haunt me, then&quot;</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I&#39;m particularly drawn to thinkers, writers, scholars and artists who boldly celebrate and acknowledge the immense power of emotions. Among them are Sappho, Virginia Woolf, FKA Twigs, and Sophie Parnok. At its core, to feel is to be human, and in a world that often values stoicism, rationality, and positivism, we risk losing touch with what truly defines us.</p>
  <p>If we want to integrate humanity into technology, we have to recognize and embrace the essential qualities that make us human - namely, the sheer beauty and raw power of emotions; something that has moved and motivated humans to create great works throughout time. By acknowledging and incorporating this aspect of humanity into our technological advancements, we are carrying on the tradition of what it means to be human, a tradition that has endured through time and space.</p>

  <h3 id="tic-tac-toe"><em>Tic Tac Toe</em></h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
  For our F2 homework, we had to create a cyber-physical agent for Tic Tac Toe. One major lesson I learned from this assignment was the importance of having a proper and clear design process for a system before delving into the technical aspects. By following a structured process for realizing the intentions of the cyber-physical system (CPS), I was able to create a meaningful interaction with the CPS.
  
  <br>
  This lesson has practical applications for my future goals. As a scholar/researcher, it's crucial to not only generate ideas, but also to implement them effectively. The ability to create a clear design process for a system can help me achieve this goal.

  <h3 id="the-struggles">The Struggles....</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
  Time management has been a major challenge for me in the BUILD course. The first few weeks involved a lot of re-adjustment to a new place, culture, and routine. My frustration peaked during Fortnight 2 when I struggled to complete the homework on time due to starting late, and poor time approximation. I am grateful to the BUILD team for granting me an extension.
  
  <p>In addition, working with the plotter has also been quite challenging. I encountered small errors here and there, and it took me several attempts to get it right. But it was worth it. </p>

  <h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next</h2>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
  To ensure that I meet the goals I've set, I will do the following:
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Maker Project</p>
  <p>My maker project involves exploring data sonification of works by great women scholars, authors, scientists, and writers. The aim is to find alternative ways of representing data while celebrating the remarkable works of women thinkers.</p>
  <p>Using Python and SoniPy, I will convert text data into audio data, providing me with an opportunity to practice working with both text and audio data. This will push my python skills to an unknown territory - namely, working with audio data and bringing the works of these women into life in another medium.</p>
  <p>I am also looking forward to including this project in my creative portfolio upon completion.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Build Homework</p>
  <p>Completing BUILD homework with proper time management. I will do this by sticking to my schedule and ask for help when needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Continue on self taught DH modules, and be in the loop of the tools or methods used by researchers in the field</p>
  <ul>
  <li>I will continue on completing the python DH modules in my spare time, and I will read papers discussing methodologies or tools that are used in the field.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>Reach out to professor and researchers working in the DH/Library-Infoscience areas.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>

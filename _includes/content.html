<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">My name is Lovira L. Putri.
  I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia,
  majoring in Cognitive Systems, specializing in Mind, Language and Computation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> I am an aspiring scholar of cognitive science
  and philosophy. My (very broad) goal in life is to attempt
  to to understand our existence through the means of exploring our
  minds, and its processes scientifically. I am also fond of exploring
  non-scientific ways to understand our existence through holistic frameworks.
   Striking a balance between those two things is what I always aim to be. </p>

<ul>
  <li> Cognitive Science, specifically Embodied cognition </li>
  <li> Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Science </li>
  <li> Cybernetics , AI Ethics, Technology-Society relations </li>

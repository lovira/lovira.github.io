<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">My name is Lovira L. Putri.
  I am a Master of Applied Cybernetics student at the Australian National University.</p>

<h2>This is my Build Journey!</h2>
</ul>

<h3> First Checkpoint</h3>

<p>The first skill I hope to develop throughout this course is (more) Python
  specifically, <b>Python for text data analysis and creative computing.</b>
</p>

<h4>Why Python for text data analysis and creative computing:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Professional/Academic:</h4></li>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> I am interested in researching the intersection of Cultural Analytics, Digital Humanities, and Library/Information Science. 
    While the details of my specific research topics are still undetermined, I am certain that I will use Python as a tool in my methodology. 
    Python is widely used in both cultural analytics and digital humanities, and I believe it will be instrumental in conducting my research.
  </p>
  <li><h4>Personal:</h4></li>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">My goal is to explore my creative abilities during my time at SoCy, utilizing the school's available resources. I think creative endeavours should not be weighed less than empirical/scientific endeavour. Rather, it should complement each other.
    I hope that by cultivating my creative side, it will have an impact on the way I approach problems in my future research and daily life, by providing inspiration or new perspectives.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>
  Current Python experience and skill level:
</h4>
<p>My current skill level is beginner-intermediate.</p>
<p>Prior coming to the School of Cybernetics, I had experience with: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Behavioral data analysis using MNE-Python package</li>
  <li>Basic text data manipulation using NLTK</li>
  <li>Self-taught Python for Digital Humanities online modules, which involved:
    <ul>
      <li>Manipulating strings</li>
      <li>Working with .txt data (files, frequency distributions, plots, regex, and web scraping)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>End Goal</h2>
<p>By the end of the course, I hope to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a portfolio showcasing my artistic work</li>
    <li>Develop a strong foundation in Python to prepare for my PhD and future research</li>
    <li>Acquire intermediate-level skills in text data analysis using Python</li>
    <li>Gain intermediate-level expertise in NLP and its applications in cultural analytics, digital humanities, and information science.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">My name is Lovira L. Putri.
  I am a Master of Applied Cybernetics student at the Australian National University.</p>

<h2>This is my Build Journey!</h2>
</ul>

<h3> First Checkpoint</h3>

<p>The first skill I hope to develop throughout this course is (more) Python
  specifically, <b>Python for text data analysis and creative computing.</b>
</p>

<h4>Why Python for text data analysis and creative computing:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Professional/Academic:</h4></li>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> I am interested in researching the intersection of Cultural Analytics, Digital Humanities, and Library/Information Science. 
    While the details of my specific research topics are still undetermined, I am certain that I will use Python as a tool in my methodology. 
    Python is widely used in both cultural analytics and digital humanities, and I believe it will be instrumental in conducting my research.
  </p>
  <li><h4>Personal:</h4></li>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">My goal is to explore my creative abilities during my time at SoCy, utilizing the school's available resources. I think creative endeavours should not be weighed less than empirical/scientific endeavour. Rather, it should complement each other.
    I hope that by cultivating my creative side, it will have an impact on the way I approach problems in my future research and daily life, by providing inspiration or new perspectives.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>
  Current Python experience and skill level:
</h4>
<p>My current skill level is beginner-intermediate.</p>
<p>Prior coming to the School of Cybernetics, I had experience with: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Behavioral data analysis using MNE-Python package</li>
  <li>Basic text data manipulation using NLTK</li>
  <li>Self-taught Python for Digital Humanities online modules, which involved:
    <ul>
      <li>Manipulating strings</li>
      <li>Working with .txt data (files, frequency distributions, plots, regex, and web scraping)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>End Goal</h2>
<p>By the end of the course, I hope to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a portfolio showcasing my artistic work</li>
    <li>Develop a strong foundation in Python to prepare for my PhD and future research</li>
    <li>Acquire intermediate-level skills in text data analysis using Python</li>
    <li>Gain intermediate-level skills in NLP and its applications in cultural analytics, digital humanities, and information science.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Journey, So Far </h2>
<h3><i>Machine Yearning</i></h3>
<p>
  I was able to explore creative computing for the first time during the first fortnight through the question #4 of the BUILD homework.
</p>
<p>My motivation for the process stemmed from a yearning for the past-- triggered by revisiting a journal entry I had written weeks prior to leaving for Canberra.</p>
<img src="/images/journal_entry.jpg" alt = "journal entry" style="width: 380px;Height:280px;">
<p>Figure 1. A snippet of my journal entry from January 14th 2023. Written at Structure Coffee, Montréal, QC</p>

<p>After revisiting my journal entry,  I  was compelled to write a poem.</p>

<code style="text-align: center;">
  <p><em>in between,</em><br>
    <em>the Lover surrenders</em><br>
    <em>a tranquil touch</em><br>
    <em>weaves in waves of rush</em><br>
    <em>a coveted muse of the pen and the brush </em>
  </p>

    <p><em>blessed by the Tenth Muse of Lesbos--</em><br>
    <em>the Lovers dance</em><br>
    <em>burning wood and chestnut scent--</em><br>
    <em>in a trance</em><br>
    <em>snowfall up north--</em><br>
    <em>burying the entrance</em></p>
    <p><em>pang!</em><br>
    <em>time is up</em><br>
    <em>at Her peak,</em><br>
    <em>the moon is now frozen</em><br>
    <em>in between,</em><br>
    <em>is now out of bounds for the Lovers</em></p>
    <p><em>Beloved,</em><br>
    <em>until then</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em><br>
    <em>haunt me</em></p>
</code>


<p>As part of the Fortnight 1 homework, we were given the task of creating a drawing with no specific guidelines, allowing for creativity. I chose to incorporate my own poem into my submission, and began thinking about how I wanted to represent the text visually. </p>
<p>I quickly realized that manually plotting each letter using the Latin alphabet would be too time-consuming, so I looked for an alternative method that would allow me to represent the poem with minimal code. Eventually, I settled on using ASCII representation, where each letter is represented by pairs of zeroes and ones. To do this, I created a function to plot zero and one, and then created functions to plot each of the four possible pairs: 00, 01, 10, and 11.</p></p>


<img src="/images/machine_yearning.jpg" style="height:300; width: 380;"

  <p><strong>Machine Yearning</strong> is an artwork consisting of five words represented in binary that depicts a crazy lover's visceral yearning for the beloved.</p>
  <p>It is a story about a separation of two lovers, wherein the mad lover begs for the beloved to haunt her until then comes around.</p>
  <p>To elucidate the sense of madness, the binary strings on the right side are ten randomised loops of the phrase "haunt me". Here, the lover is clearly consumed by the ever-consuming force of yearning for the beloved.</p>
  <p>This line was heavily inspired by a line from Emily Brontë's <em>Wuthering Heights:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"You said I killed you, Haunt me, then"</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>	I asked  ChatGPT to write an analysis of the poem, not bad!:</p>


  <p>To feel is one of the cores of being human. In a world that often prizes stoicism, rationality, and positivism, we run the risk of losing sight of what makes us truly human. To integrate humanity into technology, we must recognize and embrace the essential qualities that define us as human beings.</p>
  <p>I find myself especially drawn to thinkers and artists who boldly celebrate and acknowledge the immense power of emotions. like Sappho, Virginia Woolf, FKA Twigs, Lorde, and Audre Lorde have been a profound inspiration, inspiring me to channel my own emotions into creative expression.</p>

<h3><i>Tic Tac Toe</i></h3>
<p>	For our F2 homework, we were tasked to build an Tic Tac Toe cyber-physical agent. The process of making this started out with conceptualising the strategy 
</p>
<p>Then, Pseudocode</p>
<p>Code</p>
<p>	And interaction with the cyber-physical system </p>
<h5>The Struggles....</h5>
<p>
  Time management has been a major challenge for me in the BUILD course. The first few weeks involved a lot of re-adjustment to a new place, culture, and routine. My frustration peaked during Fortnight 2 when I struggled to complete the homework on time due to starting late. I am grateful to the BUILD team for granting me an extension.

In addition, working with the plotter has also been quite challenging. I encountered small errors here and there, and it took me several attempts to get it right.

  <h2>What's next</h2>
  <p> To ensure that I meet the goals I've set, I will do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maker Project
      <ul>
        <li>
          My maker project involves exploring data sonification of works by great women scholars, authors, scientists, and writers. The aim is to find alternative ways of representing data while celebrating the remarkable works of women. Using Python and SoniPy, I will convert text data into audio data, providing me with an opportunity to practice working with both text and audio data. I am also looking forward to including this project in my creative portfolio upon completion.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Build Homework
      <ul>
        <li>Completing BUILD homework with proper time management.</li>

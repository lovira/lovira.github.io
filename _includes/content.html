<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">My name is Lovira L. Putri.
  I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia,
  majoring in Cognitive Systems, specializing in Mind, Language and Computation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> I am an aspiring scholar of cognitive science
  and philosophy. My (very broad) goal in life is to attempt
  to understand our existence through the means of exploring our
  minds, and its processes empirically as well as philosophically.
  Striking a balance between those two approaches is what I always aim to be. </p>
<p> Here are some of my current interests:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Cognitive Science, specifically Embodied cognition </li>
  <li> Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Science </li>
  <li> Cybernetics </li>
  <li>Technology-Society relations </li>
  <li> (Psycho)Linguistics </li>
</ul>

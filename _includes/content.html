<h2>About Me</h2>

<div>
<p style="text-align:justify">My name is Lovira L. Putri.
  I am a <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/">Master of Applied Cybernetics</a> student at the Australian National University.</p>

  <p>
    My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>Information Science, Digital Humanities, 
    and GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums)</b>. I am particularly fascinated by the 
    application of computational methods and tools, such as machine learning, for the analysis 
    and management of digital cultural and historical data commonly found within GLAM institutions.
    <br>
    <br>
    As the humanities undergo a significant shift towards digitization and computerization, it is crucial to address the underrepresentation of non-Western, 
    non-Anglo cultures in this field. My other interest is to identify tools and methodologies that can support cultures with limited infrastructure 
    in digitizing their cultural and heritage data so that those cultures are well represented and included in the research and academic discourse of 
    this field.
